## Inspiration
---
The inspiration behind this project is to deliver a decentralized application (DApp) for secure data aggregation using homomorphic encryption on StarkNet. Below is a detailed description of the flow:

## DApp Flow:
---

#### 1. **User Onboarding:**
   - Users start by accessing the DApp through a web interface or StarkNet-compatible wallet.

#### 2. **StarkNet Wallet Integration:**
   - Users connect their StarkNet-compatible wallets (such as [Argent X](https://www.argent.xyz/argent-x/) or [Braavos](https://braavos.app/) ) to the DApp for secure authentication and transaction signing.

#### 3. **Homomorphic Encryption Setup:**
   - The DApp educates users about homomorphic encryption and guides them in encrypting their sensitive data locally using suitable cryptographic libraries.

#### 4. **Data Contribution Initialization:**
   - Users initiate the data contribution process through the DApp, specifying the type of data they want to contribute (e.g., financial, health).

#### 5. **Local Encryption and Proof Generation:**
   - On the user's device, the DApp locally encrypts the user's data using homomorphic encryption.
   - A zero-knowledge proof is generated to attest to the correctness of the encryption without revealing the actual data.

#### 6. **Transaction Submission to StarkNet:**
   - The encrypted data and proof are bundled into a transaction.
   - The transaction is submitted to the StarkNet contract securely using the connected wallet.

#### 7. **Smart Contract Verification:**
   - The StarkNet contract receives the transaction and verifies the zero-knowledge proof to confirm the correctness of the encrypted data without actually decrypting it.

#### 8. **Encrypted Data Storage on StarkNet:**
   - The contract stores the encrypted data on StarkNet's secure storage, ensuring data integrity and privacy.

#### 9. **Data Aggregation Trigger:**
   - A trigger, such as a specified time interval or a certain threshold of contributed data, initiates the data aggregation process on the StarkNet contract.

#### 10. **Homomorphic Computation:**
   - The StarkNet contract performs homomorphic computations on the encrypted data, aggregating the contributions without decrypting the individual pieces of data.

#### 11. **Result Storage and Access:**
   - The aggregated result is stored on StarkNet, and users can access it securely through the DApp using their wallets.

#### 12. **User Verification:**
   - Users can locally verify the correctness of the aggregated result using cryptographic proofs without revealing their individual contributions.

#### 13. **Privacy Settings:**
   - Users may have options to set privacy preferences, controlling who can access the aggregated results and under what conditions.

#### 14. **Decentralized Governance (Optional):**
   - Optionally, a decentralized governance mechanism allows users to participate in decision-making processes related to the DApp's operation and parameters.

#### 15. **User Notifications:**
   - Users receive notifications through the DApp or their connected wallets to stay informed about the status of their contributions and the aggregated results.

#### 16. **Data Deletion Option:**
   - Users may have the option to request the deletion of their contributed encrypted data from the StarkNet contract, adhering to privacy concerns.

This flow ensures that sensitive information is securely contributed, aggregated, and analyzed on StarkNet without the need to expose the actual data to the contract. The combination of homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proofs provides a robust privacy-preserving solution for secure data aggregation.

## What's next for Stash?

I hope to keep building and adding awesome features to the build.

## Deploy on Vercel
---
The easiest way to deploy your Dapp is to use the [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) Platform from the creators of Next.js.
